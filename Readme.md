# Cloudi OS: A Linux Distro for Project Managers

### Introduction: The Problem

Project managers are buried under tools — Jira, Slack, Notion, Teams, Gantt charts, spreadsheets — yet none of it feels cohesive. Most Linux distros are built for developers or sysadmins. What if we built one just for those who lead?

### The Vision: What is Cloudi OS?

Cloudi OS is a lightweight, focused Linux distribution designed for project managers, scrum masters, product owners, and cross-functional leads. It brings together essential tools, dashboards, and calm design to help you manage projects, track status, and stay productive — without tool overload.

### Why PMs Deserve Their Own OS

- No existing OS is optimized for the mental model of a PM  
- Most distros assume you're coding — PMs are coordinating  
- Calendar + meetings + sprints + docs + flow → fragmented  
- You waste energy switching tools instead of staying in flow  
- You deserve a calm command center, not an app overload

### Who Is It For?

- Remote project managers  
- Agile coaches and Scrum Masters  
- Technical product owners  
- Engineering managers  
- Anyone tired of managing teams inside cluttered environments

### How It's Built

Cloudi OS is based on debian , i use ansible to generate the OS , is in very early stages & I really want to avoid just another distro feeling on top of debian :) 

### Why Not Just Use [X]?

“Why not just install apps on your current distro?”  
You could — but the goal here is to create a focused experience where everything feels ready out of the box, curated for how PMs actually think and work.

### What’s Next?

- Looking for early testers, designers, and feedback

### Conclusion

Developers have their Arch. Creatives have their macOS.  
It’s time Project Managers had an OS of their own.  
Welcome to Cloudi OS — where clarity meets calm.
