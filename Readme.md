# Cloudi OS

Howdy  Cloudi ? **Cloudi OS** is a fast, lightweight, and powerful Debian-based Linux distribution built for **cloud-native and AI developers**. With essential tools preinstalled, a clean XFCE interface, and full automation, Cloudi gives you a productive environment out of the box â€” whether you're building models, deploying containers, or coding in the cloud.

**DISCLAIMER : Just started, wait for the release iso files :)**
